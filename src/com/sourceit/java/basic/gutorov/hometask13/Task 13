1. For each of the following four tasks, specify which of the Java Collections member is best suited, and explain how to use it 
to implement the task. (You do not need to write any code. Just give an idea of how you would use the component to solve the problem.
 Or you could implement your idea.) 
- Whimsical Toys Inc (WTI) needs to record the names of all its employees. Every month, an employee will be chosen at random
 from these records to receive a free toy. 
- WTI has decided that each new product will be named after an employee – but only first names will be used, and each name will be used
 only once. Prepare a list of unique first names. 
- WTI decides that it only wants to use the most popular names for its toys. Count the number of employees who have each first name.
- WTI acquires season tickets for the local lacrosse team, to be shared by employees. Create a waiting list for this popular sport.

 2. For each of the four tasks above, specify which of the Java Collections Framework interfaces is best suited, and explain any
  differences in how you would use it compared to the Java Collections component you chose to handle the task.

-	    List & Random. 

We need all employers & randomize one(some?) from this list to receiving a toy 

-       Set.remove ()

 According to unique first names we will use set collection & removing it after using
 
-       HashMap (Key = firstName, Value = count)

sorting by value needed – it will be most popular names in WTI

-       Queue.remove()

FIFO with removing first elements
